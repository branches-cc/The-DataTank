This means that if you want to work with the latest code you best clone our develop branch instead of downloading a .zip of .tar.gz file from our Downloads section.\r\n\r\n# Being a developer #\r\n\r\n## Branches ##\r\n\r\n### Develop ###\r\n\r\nThis is the working branch. It mostly ontains code that works. The Master branch (currently) is not (!!) up to date, that's why we encourage using the develop for the most bug fixes and features are implemented. Once we've fully tested the develop branch, it will be merged to the master branch.\r\n\r\nOther branches that are used to work on features, which are later merged with develop are currently hierarchical_packaging (as good as done) and iSoc12 (work in progress, but already alot of very cool stuff)\r\n\r\nTo checkout which new issues or features we are working, please check out our issues list, or the markdown files in the github repo. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact ##\r\n\r\nHaving problems ?
