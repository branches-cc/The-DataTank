# Installation

To install the datatank, just clone our repo (develop branch, or master branch starting from 10th of august 2012). Then just deploy it somewhere on your server and go to the /installer part of the deployment in your browser. 
I.e. http://myhost/installer, also RENAME the Config.example.class.php to Config.class.php, that should provide with all the necessary info to get you started!

# develop

This is the development branch, this branch will be merged with separate branches where big features will be implemented separatly. When a branch is adult enough to merge it with the development branch, it will be merged and deleted. For small fixes and very small features the development will be adjusted without branching first. This branch is the most up to date version of The DataTank.

Take a look at the issues-section for further discussion and features!

# The DataTank & FlatData #

In order to set up an API we're using the open-source platform The DataTank. The DataTank is free software (AGPL, Â© 2011,2012 iRail NPO, 2012 OKFN Belgium) to create an API for non-local/dynamic data in no time.

If you want to read more about The DataTank please visit http://thedatatank.com for developer documentation, and http://thedatatank.com for introductions.

FlatTurtle has forked The DataTank to create a platform which integrates seaminglessly with our other products, like http://github.com/FlatTurtle/InfoScreen. This fork of The DataTank is called FlatData.
