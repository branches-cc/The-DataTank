## Branching ##

We have a lot of branches. In order to understand them we suggest you read this first:

### Master ###

This is the "stable" branch. It only contains code that works. In the future, different versions of The DataTank will be added as tags. We do however encourage to take a look at the develop branch, this branch contains the latest updates, but may contain some minor bugs.

### develop ### 

This is the development branch, this branch will be merged with separate branches where big features will be implemented separatly. When a branch is adult enough to merge it with the development branch, it will be merged and deleted. For small fixes and very small features the development will be adjusted without branching first.

Take a look at the issues-section for further discussion and features!

Any questions? Add a support issue.
